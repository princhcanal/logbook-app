# Logbook App

This app was created in collaboration with [John Earl P. Bascos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-earl-bascos-055a341a8/), [Ma. Dina Gene Dela Torre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ma-dina-gene-dela-torre-b67b571bb/), Seth Angelo Llenos, and John Patrick Mandal for our project in CpE340 - Modern System Analysis and Design class.

It is meant to be used by working students at [Cebu Institute of Technology - University](https://cit.edu/) for storing their logs online. Users can create and delete logs from their department and read and update logs of other departments. Users can also see other users' activity by visiting their profile.
